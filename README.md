# IProject
A project that takes the table with COVID-19 cases and creates 3 charts. Those charts are saved in a folder.

#User Guide
It contains a Word Document where I explain briefly how the code works and what will be the expected outputs.

#Technical Documentation
Here I wrote in another Word Document what Programming Language I used, what where my thoughts and how I created the charts with this programming language.

#Project Schedule
I created also a schedule with my word during my project in order to be more organised.
